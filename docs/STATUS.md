# Status

## Completed (bootstrap)

- Expo SDK 57 + TypeScript scaffold (`blank-typescript`), Android-first `app.json` (package `com.vestibular.screeningaid`).
- Domain structure: `ui/ patients/ tests/ camera/ eyetracking/ signals/ metrics/ storage/ config/ utils/`.
- Minimal `HomeScreen` boot check wired via `App.tsx`.
- Tooling: ESLint (`eslint-config-expo`, flat), Prettier, `typecheck`/`lint`/`check` scripts; `eas.json` dev profile stubbed for later.
- Docs: README, AGENTS, `docs/{PROJECT_SPEC,ARCHITECTURE,ROADMAP,DECISIONS,STATUS}.md`.

## Verification (2026-09-24, Expo SDK 57, Node 25)

- `npm run typecheck` — pass.
- `npm run lint` — pass.
- `npm run format` — pass.
- `npx expo-doctor` — 21/21 pass.
- App entry (`App.tsx` → `HomeScreen`) verified by type/lint; runtime boot check in Expo Go is the next manual step on the Redmi device.
- No camera/tracking/auth/DB code present by design (stubs only).

## Next task (was: Camera2 capability probe)

**P0.1 hardening done (2026-09-24), on-device run still pending — NOT complete:**
`modules/expo-camera2-probe` (Android-only Kotlin local module) queries the real
Camera2 API for every `CameraManager.cameraIdList` camera: ID, lens facing,
hardware level, sensor orientation, AE FPS ranges, constrained-high-speed-video
flag, all `getHighSpeedVideoSizes()` + per-size `getHighSpeedVideoFpsRangesFor()`.
TS seam: `src/camera/camera2Probe{,Types}.ts`; debug UI: `Camera2ProbeScreen`.
Nothing hard-coded.

- Strict verdicts (`getHighSpeedTargetVerdict`): a target fps is YES only with a
  fixed `[fps, fps]` range; matching just a range maximum is UPPER, never
  support; interior matches (e.g. 120 inside `[30, 240]`) are NOT_ADVERTISED.
  Verified by 7/7 passing execution tests on synthetic Camera2 data.
- Permission review (API 29+): verified against AOSP that none of the six probe
  keys needs CAMERA permission (only lens/sensor calibration keys are gated);
  reads stay null-safe. No permission declared/requested; camera never opened.

## Verification (P0.1 hardening)

- `npm run check` (typecheck + lint) — pass. `npx prettier --check .` — pass.
- `npx expo prebuild --no-install --platform android` — pass; autolinking
  resolves `com.vestibular.screeningaid.camera2probe.ExpoCamera2ProbeModule`.
- Full native compile — **pass**: `:app:assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  (193 tasks, 0 failed; `:expo-camera2-probe:compileDebugKotlin` OK;
  `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`, 136 MB).
  Build env (Mac arm64): SDK installed at `~/Library/Android/sdk`
  (platform-tools 37.0.1, platforms/build-tools 35+36), Gradle 9.3.1.
  Build must run under JDK 21 (`JAVA_HOME=.../openjdk@21`): JDK 26 breaks
  AGP 8.12 prefab (JVM restricted-method warning parsed as fatal).
- On-device acceptance — **pending, P0.1 cannot be marked complete**:
  `adb devices` reports no device attached. Missing prerequisite: the physical
  Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G connected via USB (debugging on), then
  `npx expo run:android --device`. No camera IDs / FPS results recorded yet —
  do not infer capability from Xiaomi slow-motion modes.

## Next task

**On-device P0.1 validation:** Dev Build on the Redmi, record the probe report
(resolutions/fps, front-camera limits), then go/no-go for Phase 2. Still no
tracking/recording (out of scope for P0.1).
